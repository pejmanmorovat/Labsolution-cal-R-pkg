## Installation
- First Install devtools from CRAN

  install.packages("devtools")

- Then Install LabSolution by devtools package

  devtools::install_github("pejmanmorovat/Labsolution-cal-R-pkg")

- Now use it
  
  library(LabSolution)

- Alternatively, you can install LabSoultion using remotes package (CRAN)

  install.packages("remotes")

  remotes::install_github("pejmanmorovat/Labsolution-cal-R-pkg")

- Now use it

  library(LabSolution)
## Functions:
## 1- molarity {LabSolution}	

- Description: 

An amount of solute in one unit of a solution is known as the molar concentration. The unit of measurement is mol/L, mol/dm3, or mol/m3. In molar concentration, also known as molarity, the unit M refers to the molar.

- Usage: 

molarity (p,  d,  fw)

- Arguments:

p --> 	
Purity of solution. Percentage purity of a substance can be calculated by dividing the mass of the pure chemical by the total mass of the sample, and then multiplying this number by 100

d -->	
Density of solution. To determine the solution's density, weigh a precisely measured volume of your solution, and divide the mass of solution by the volume of solution. You must measure the volume of solution to obtain the density

fw -->
Formula weight (Molecular weight or molar mass) of the solute. If the mass of the unknown solute is known, then its molar mass can be calculated using the formula: Molar mass of solute = mass of solute/number of moles of solute

- Value:

10 * p (the percentage purity) * d (density of solution(g/cm3)) / fw (Molar mass(g/mol))

- Example:

What is the molarity of concentrated sulfuric acid if its purity is 96 percent and its density is 1.84 grams per liter? 
(The molecular weight of HSO4 is 97.064 g/mol.)

molarity(96,1.84,97.064)

 18.1983 mol/L
 
 

## 2- mgrams {LabSolution}

- Description:

Determination of the amount of solute in grams for preparing the solution when the unit of solution concentration is the molarity

- Usage:

mgrams (V, molarity, fw)

- Arguments:

V -->
Volume of solution (ml)

molarity -->	
moles of solute / liters of solution (mol/L).

fw -->
Formula weight or molar mass of the solute

- Value:

v * molarity * fw / 1000

- Example:

To make 250 ml of an aqueous solution with [NaCl] = 0.8 M. What mass of the solute would we need to make this solution? (Molecular weight of sodium chloride= 58.44 g/mol)

mgrams(250,0.8,58.44)

11.688 g

## 3- normality {LabSolution}

- Description:

Normality is the number of equivalents per liter of solution.

- Usage:

normality (p, d, eqval)

- Arguments:

p -->
Purity of solution. Percentage purity of a substance can be calculated by dividing the mass of the pure chemical by the total mass of the sample, and then multiplying this number by 100

d -->
Density of solution. To determine the solution's density, weigh a precisely measured volume of your solution, and divide the mass of solution by the volume of solution. You must measure the volume of solution to obtain the density

eqval -->	
Equivalent: In a chemical reaction, an equivalent is the amount of a substance that reacts with (or is equivalent to) an arbitrary amount (typically one mole) of another substance

- Value:

10 * p * d / eqval

- Example:

What is the normality of a 96 per cent solution of H2SO4 of specific gravity 1.84 g/mL?

normality(96,1.84,49.039)

36.02031 eq/L

## 4- eqval {LabSolution}

- Description:

Equivalent: In a chemical reaction, an equivalent is the amount of a substance that reacts with (or is equivalent to) an arbitrary amount (typically one mole) of another substance

- Usage:

eqval (fw, n)

- Arguments:

fw -->	
Formula weight (Molecular weight or molar mass) of the solute

n -->	
The number of equivalents that changes by ionization

- Value:

fw / n

- Example:

What is the gram equivalent weight of phosphoric acid, H3PO4?(fw= molecular weight in g/mol, n= number of equivalents)

eqval(127,3)

42.33333 g/eq

## 5- normality2 {LabSolution}

- Description:

It's another function for the determination of the normality of the solution.

- Usage:

normality2 (molarity, n)

- Arguments:

molarity -->	
Molarity of solution (mol/L). moles of solute/liters of solution

n -->
The number of equivalents that changes by ionization

- Value:

molarity * n

- Example:

What is the normality of Sulfuric Acid?(molarity of H2SO4 96 percent= 18.01)

normality2(18.01,2)

36.02 eq/L

## 6- ngrams {LabSolution}

- Description:

Determination of the amount of solute in grams for preparing the solution when the unit of solution concentration is normality.

- Usage:

ngrams (v, normality, eqval)

- Arguments:

v -->	
Volume of solution (ml)

normality -->	
Normality of solution. Number of gram equivalents/volume of solution in liters (eq/L)

eqval -->
Equivalent: In a chemical reaction, an equivalent is the amount of a substance that reacts with (or is equivalent to) an arbitrary amount (typically one mole) of another substance

n -->
The number of equivalents that changes by ionization

- Value:

v * normality * eqval / 1000

- Example:

To make 150 ml of an aqueous solution with [NaCl] = 10 N. What mass of the solute would we need to make this solution?

ngrams(150,10,1)

1.5 g 

## 7- vol {LabSolution}


- Description:

Using the following equation, you can figure out the concentration or volume of the concentrated or diluted solution

- Usage:

vol (V, molarity, m)

- Arguments:

V -->	
is the volume of the dilute solution

molarity -->
is the concentration in molarity of the dilute solution (after more solvent has been added)

m -->
is the concentration in molarity (mol/L) of the concentrated solution

- Value:

V * molarity / m

- Example:

Prepare 100 mL of 1.0 M hydrochloric acid from concentrated (12.1 M) hydrochloric acid.

vol(100,1,12)

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am Pejman Morovat, a biotechnologist who devotes most of his time to research in bioinformatics. Having the opportunity to work in a lab and analyze data and meta-data is very rewarding for me. In my field, I am constantly putting new ideas to use, and I enjoy being creative during my research.

I developed this R package to make it easier to calculate laboratory solutions production for my thesis in the laboratory at Babol university of medical science.
